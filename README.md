# flutter_health_app
This repository contains the codebase for the our Bachelor thesis. The aim of the project is to create the initial version of an mobile application for iOS and Android that utilizes mobile sensors and surveys. It aims to collect health-related information from individuals undergoing dose tapering of depression medication. The ultimate goal is to gather this data and employ machine learning to predict their next dosage adjustment. The prediction process considers their reported symptoms and health information.

## Main Features
* Integrates with mobile sensors and health app for  health-related data collection.
* Incorporates an questionnaire system that allows a diverse range of questionnaire types
* Presents collected information to users in a clear and user-friendly interface.
* Facilitates the extraction of collected data, supporting integration with analytics platforms
